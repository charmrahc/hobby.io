  <h2><b>Welcome to this website which tells you more about my hobby: Museum Hopping!</b></h2>
</div>
<div style="text-align:left; margin-left: 10px">
  <h3>What is museum hopping?</h3>
  <p>Museum hopping is much like cafe hopping, just that instead of checking out different cafes, you are going from one museum to another!</p>
  <h3>Why do I enjoy museum hopping?</h3>
  <p>Well...for a start, I am a history buff and enjoy exploring different things related to history, so museums are naturally fascinating! But over time I've also come to appreciate that there is a wide variety of museums and not all of them may be history-centric (as you'll see in the list of museums I'm reviewing here). What I also find particularly endearing about museums is the emphasis on different sensory experiences to help us understand something better. Museums are a great place for people to learn new stuff in a less intellectual way!</p>
  <h3>How does this website work?</h3>
  <p>I hope that through this website, you can learn a bit more about each of the three musuems: National Museum of Singapore, Asian Civilisations Museum and Madame Tussauds Singapore. Click on the photos below to start checking out the museum of interest or click on any of the horizontal tabs above!</p>
